# 🌕 Mercury Live Coding Environment 

**Welcome to Mercury! ✌️ ☮️ Make Music, Not War!** ☮️ ✌️

**Mercury is a free/open-source, beginner-friendly, minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music performances**

In the menu on the left side you can find everything you need, from [About](about) and [Getting Started](getting-started) to Tips&Tricks, How-To's and the [Reference](./reference/syntax.md). Also make sure you check out the [Collaborative Coding](collaborate) chapter, because making music together is fun!

<!-- Mercury currently has 2 versions:

* Original version running in Max8 (Windows/Mac only) (you're in the right place)
* Web version running in the browser (Windows/Mac/Linux) [go to this repo](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury-playground) -->

[**🚀 Start coding directly in the playground!**](https://mercury.timohoogland.com/)

[**🙏 Support Mercury by buying me a coffee ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/tmhglnd)

## ☮️ Make Music, Not War!

:::info Life on earth is in crisis. Please support a charity! No one is too small to make a difference!

**We live in a war-torn world, where millions of people have their lives destroyed by conflict. On top of that our climate is changing faster than scientists predicted and the stakes are high.**

If you enjoy the work I do and consider donating money for my efforts, then please instead (or also) consider donating that money to a charity like:

[**International Committee of the Red Cross**](https://www.icrc.org/en/donate) | [**Doctors Without Borders**](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/secure/rr-donate-monthly-web?source=ADU2011U0W46) | [**Oxfam International**](https://www.oxfam.org/en?form=general) | [**Save the Children**](https://support.savethechildren.org/site/Donation2?df_id=1620&1620.donation=form1) | [**World Wildlife Fund**](https://protect.worldwildlife.org/page/65220/donate/1?en_og_source=Web_Donation&ea.tracking.id=Web_Topnav&supporter.appealCode=AWE2402OQ18299A01179RX) | [**Extinction Rebellion**](https://rebellion.global/) | [**Future For Fridays**](https://fridaysforfuture.org/what-we-do/contact-us/#countries) | [**Greenpeace**](https://engage.us.greenpeace.org/onlineactions/GB7jeaDze0eR5tWt3kWG_w2?sourceid=1015094)

Or find another high-rated charity you like to support on for example [CharityWatch](https://www.charitywatch.org/) and [CharityNavigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)

## ✨ Inspiration

During the development of Mercury (both the playground and the full version) I've found inspiration in many other live coding environments, practices and platforms. Some of these are:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/) - Live coding visual synthesizer by Olivia Jack
- [Sema](https://sema.codes/about) - Live coding language design platform combined with Machine Learning
- [MIMIC Project](https://mimicproject.com/about) - a web platform for the artistic exploration of musical machine learning and machine listening.
- [Tidal](https://tidalcycles.org/index.php/Welcome) - Live coding of patterns
- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) - The live coding synth for everyone
- [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) - Webaudio framework for programming synths and sequencers
- [Nearley](https://nearley.js.org/) - Parsing toolkit
