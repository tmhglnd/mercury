# fx

## reverb

Add an reverberation effect to the sound. The effect has 2 arguments, the amplitude of the reverb and the reverb-length. The amplitude is specified in floating-point linear gain and the length is a value between `0` and `20`. The default is `0.5` amplitude and `10` length.

```
fx(reverb <amplitude, optional> <reverb-length-0-19, optional>)
```
example
```
new sample snare_909 time(1) fx(reverb 1 15)
```

## delay

Add a pingpong delay effect to the sound. The effect has 4 arguments, the left delaytime, the right delaytime, the feedback and the damping. The delaytime is specified in bar time divisions, where `0.25` (or `1/4`) is a quarter note. The feedback is specified as a value between `0` and `1`. Positive feedback is allowed and internally compressed, but watch out for your ears in any case. The damping is a lowpass filter for which the cutoff is specified between `0` and `1` where 0 means full damping, and 1 means none.

```
fx(delay <time-division> <time-division> <feedback> <damping>)
```
example
```
new sample hat_click time(1/2) fx(delay 3/16 7/16 0.5 0.7)
```

## filter

Add a filter to the sound. This can be a static filter or a modulated filter depending on the amount of arguments you provide. The filter-type can be a `low`, `high` or `band`-pass filter. The second argument is the cutoff frequency in Hz and the third argument is the resonance between `0` and `1`. 

```
fx(filter <type> <cutoff> <resonance>)
```
example
```
new synth saw note(0 1) shape(-1) fx(filter low 200 0.6)
```

Alternatively you can provide extra arguments to have the filter modulate between a low and high cutoff-frequency. In this case the arguments are as follows (in order): The filter-type `low | high | band`. The modulation speed in float/expression as musical time division where `0.25` or `1/4` = a quarter note. The high cutoff in Hz, the low cutoff in Hz the resonance between `0` and `1`. The modulation shape tilt between `0` and `1`, where 0 is ramp-down, 1 is ramp-up and 0.5 is triangle form. The exponential curve for the filter as floating point. 

```
fx(filter <type> <modulation> <hi-cut> <lo-cut> <res> <shape-tilt> <exponent>)
```
example
```
new synth saw note(0 0) shape(-1) fx(filter low 1/4 100 1500 0.5 0 0.2)
```

## lfo

Add an Low Frequency Oscillator effect to the sound. 

```
fx(lfo <time-division>)
```

## double

Add an Automated-Double-Tracking (ADT) effect to the sound. This will give the effect as if there were two of the same sounds, one left and one right.

```
fx(double)
```

## drive

Add some distortion to the sound.

```
fx(drive <drive-amount >= 0>)
```

## chip

Add a downsampling effect (most characterized as chiptune/8bit sound)

```
fx(chip <degrade-samplerate-0-1>)
```
