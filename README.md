**Control external midi devices or send midi to other Applications with the new `midi` instrument**

```java
set midi getPorts
//=> prints the available devices to the console

new midi "Your Awesome Midi Device" time(1/4) note(7 1) length(100) gain(0.8)
```

**Input OSC addresses as arguments or output osc-messages in a similar way as using instruments**

```java
set osc default

new synth sine name(sn)
    set sn note(/sine/pitch 0) shape(5 /sine/release)
    set sn fx(reverb 1 /sine/verb)

new emitter osc name(myOSC) someParam(3.14)
    // result => /myOsc/someParam 3.14
``` -->

## 📟 About 

**Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language for the live coding of algorithmic electronic music.** 

All elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the editor is restricted to 30 lines of code, keeping all code always visible. Mercury provides the performer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate or transform numbersequences that can modulate parameters, such as melody and rhythm, over time. The environment produces sound in conjunction with visuals. Besides looking at the code, the audience is also looking at the visuals that are reactive to the sound or generated by the sound.

It is named after te planet Mercury. Mercury rules the creation and expression of our mental processes. The planet implores us to express ourselves. Mercury is about a quick wit, quick thinking. It lets us move from one thing to the next.

Mercury is programmed in the Cycling'74 Max8 node-based creative coding environment, as an abstracted layer on the Max/MSP audio engine and with the use of Node4Max for parsing, lexing and generative algorithms and Jitter/OpenGL for the visuals and the responsive texteditor.

Mercury uses the [Total Serialism NodeJS](https://github.com/tmhglnd/total-serialism#total-serialism) package available on npmjs.com. This package contains an extensive library of algorithmic composition methods.

- Use the environment as a teaching environment for:
	- introduction to (electronic) music
	- algorithmic composition
	- sequencing and pattern generating
	- sound design
	- creative coding and live coding
- Provide creatives with an hands-on language to create realtime processes
	- code sound and music
	- code visuals and let them react to sound
- Provide creatives with an extensive library of algorithmic composition techniques

## 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Collaborative Coding

You can code together in Mercury using the amazing [**Flok**](https://flok.cc/) live coding environment in the browser. The easiest way to get started is by combining **Flok** with the **Mercury Playground**, but you can also combine Flok with this Mercury standalone running in Max8.

- [Start coding together here](./docs/collaborate.md)

<!-- 
There are 3 options for how you can use Flok with Mercury:
1. Use Flok to combine Mercury with Hydra visuals (or other languages like Tidal, Foxdot and SuperCollider) on a localhost
2. Collaborate together in the same room (only requires 1 computer to run Mercury)
3. Collaborate remotely over a network (all computers need to run Mercury)

Install NodeJS v.12 [for Mac](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/node-v12.20.0.pkg) or [for Windows](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/node-v12.20.0-x64.msi).

Install the latest version of Mercury via the [quick start quide](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/blob/master/docs/quick-start.md).

Install Flok via the Terminal with `npm install -g flok-web flok-repl`

**Localhost**

1. Run `flok-web` in the terminal
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `localhost:3000`
3. Setup Flok with target `mercury` (and optionally other targets like `hydra`) and click **Create session**.
4. Copy the `flok-repl -H xxx -s xxx -t mercury` command and run in the terminal.
5. **Join** the Flok with your nickname.

**Collaborate**

Now follow these steps for a succesful setup.
1. Open Google Chrome and go to [https://flok.clic.cf/](https://flok.clic.cf/)
1. Setup Flok with target `mercury` and click **Create session**.
2. Copy the `flok-repl -H xxx -s xxx -t mercury` command and run in the terminal.
4. **Join** the Flok with your nickname.

Now start typing some code! 🎵

- `Ctrl/Alt + Return` to evaluate
- `Ctrl/Alt + .` to silence

Flok will send the entire code via OSC messaging to port 4880. Mercury should be listening to this port automatically. Bug reports are very much welcome in the issues! -->

## 💻 Install

- 📖 [I need some help installing](./docs/tutorial.md)
- 🚀 [I'm an experienced computer user](./docs/quick-start.md)
- 💻 [Is my computer powerful enough?](#-system-requirements)

OR

- 🤓 I'll just [download](https://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury/releases) and figure it out myself

```
$ cd ~/Documents/Max\ 8/Projects
$ git clone http://github.com/tmhglnd/mercury
$ cd mercury
$ open mercury_ide/mercury_ide.maxproj
```

<!-- ### 📖 Tutorial -->

<!-- 🚧 (work in progress) 🚧 -->

<!-- If this is your first time with either the usage of creative coding software (like Max8), music theory, electronic music making and programming in general I highly recommend following the tutorial. -->

<!-- [Open the Tutorial](./docs/tutorial.md) -->

### ⚠ Troubleshooting

It could be that you are having issues with Mercury. Please follow the steps below:

- [Open the Troubleshooting](./docs/08-troubleshooting.md)

### 📖 Documentation

- [Open the documentation](./docs/table-of-content.md)

### 💻 System Requirements

These system requirements are recommended to install and run Max and Mercury on your computer. Lower specs may work but it's not guaranteed. A dedicated Graphics Card (GPU) is also recommended to run the visual side of Mercury smoothly (the text-editor runs on the graphics card as well).

| OS | CPU | RAM |
| -- | --- | --- |
| Mac OSX 10.13 (at least 10.11.6+) | Intel i5 processor | 8 GB | 
| Windows 10 (7 or 8 may work) | Intel i5 or AMD mult-core processor | 8 GB |

<!-- ### 🛠 Build Application

`Optional`

**Why?** - Building the Application is recommended when using Mercury with other MaxMSP projects. This will allow Mercury to have a seperate thread from the other Max processes, giving it enough RAM and CPU space. Also the application will probably run more stable because the project can not be editted anymore. This, of course, also dependents on your system specifications.

**How?** - The Cycling'74 Max8 coding environment is needed to build the application from the `mercury_ide_x.x.x.maxproj` file. Open the `.maxproj` file and select `Build Collective/Application` from the `Settings` menu on the bottom of the project window. *Building the Application is not necessary in order to run the environment!* -->
